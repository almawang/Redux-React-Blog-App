# Redux React Blog
I implemented a blog using redux's action and reducer system. It has the following features:

* All links change color with hover.
* Navigation bar on top with link to homepage (AlmaBlog) and to page to create a new post.
* New Post page has fields for title, content and tags and a create new post button.
* Index - lists the titles and tags of all available blog posts. The titles are links to the fully blog posts.
* Show - Clicking on the title of a post opens up a link to the full blog post with content.
* Edit - After opening up a full blog post, edit the blog post by clicking on the edit button. The content field supports markdown and can contain multiple lines. To save the edited work click on the edit button again and the updated post will be sent to the API.
* Delete - Click on the delete button to delete the post.
